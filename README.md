## Quick Example

``` objective-c
@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] enableLocalNotification];
    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] startWithAppleId:@"584296227"];
    
    return YES;
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
{
    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] openInAppStore];
}

@end
```

## Customize

You can also customize Pigeon as you wish. REMEMBER to set the customizable properties before you call `startWithAppleId:`;

Manage the `latestVersion` yourself, so `Pigeon` won't fetch it from App Store.

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *latestVersion;
```

The message of local notification.

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *updateMessage;
```

The country code ( @"us", @"ru" for example ). You should set this code, if your application is not available in all countries. 

``` objective-c
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *countyCode;
```

The notify interval. Default values is one day.

``` objective-c
@property (assign, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval notifyInterval;
```

## One More Thing

`Pigeon` will post a notification when finding a new version. You can observe it and notify users in the way you prefer, a UIAlertView for example.

``` objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(showNewVersionAlertView) name:PigeonDidFindNewVersionNotification object:nil];
```
